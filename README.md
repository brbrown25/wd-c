wd
==

`wd` (*warp directory*) lets you jump to custom directories in your terminal, without using `cd`. Why? Because `cd` seems inefficient when the folder is frequently visited or has a long path.

*NOTE*: This is a port written in `c`, which can be used in all shells using a wrappers. If you're using oh-my-zsh, check out the [original](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd).
