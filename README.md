wd
==

`wd` (*warp directory*) lets you jump to custom directories in zsh, without using `cd`. Why? Because `cd` seems ineffecient when the folder is frequently visited or has a long path.

*NOTE*: This is a port written in `c`, which can be used in all emulators using a wrappers. If you're using zsh, check out the [original](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd).

### Install

`_wd`:

    $ make release
    # make install

Wrapper:

    TODO

### Usage

See [original `zsh` version](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd).
